# TapRoom

This webpage could be use both by a bartender or a patron. Bartender can chack the beers, refill them, put one or all of them on sale, and finally serve them to clients. Patrons also can see the menu contains beer's infos and pricesand then request it to bartender. ( It is incomplete for now. I have plan to work more on it later)
